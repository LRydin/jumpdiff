Other functions and options
---------------------------
Include in this package is also the `Milstein scheme <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milstein_method>`_ of integration, particularly important when the diffusion term has some spacial :code:`x` dependence. :code:`moments` can actually calculate the conditional moments for different lags, using the parameter :code:`lag`.

In :code:`formulae` the set of formulas needed to calculate the second order corrections are given (in :code:`sympy`).
