Installation
============

For the moment the library is available from TestPyPI, so you can use

::

   pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ JumpDiff

Then on your favourite editor just use

.. code:: python

   import JumpDiff as jd

The library depends on :code:`numpy`, :code:`scipy`, and :code:`sympy`.
