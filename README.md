# JumpDiff
`JumpDiff` is a `python` library with non-parametric Nadaraya─Watson estimators to extract the parameters of jump-diffusion processes.
With `JumpDiff` one can extract the parameters of a jump-diffusion process from one-dimensional timeseries, employing both a kernel-density estimation method combined with a set on second-order corrections for a precise retrieval of the parameters for short timeseries.

## Installation
To install `JumpDiff`, run

```
   pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ JumpDiff
```

Then on your favourite editor just use

```python
   import JumpDiff as jd
```

## Dependencies
The library parameter estimation depends on `numpy` and `scipy` solely. The mathematical formulae depend on `scypy`. It stems from [`kramersmoyal`](https://github.com/LRydin/KramersMoyal) project, but functions independently from it<sup>3</sup>.

## Documentation
You can find the documentation [here](https://jumpdiff.readthedocs.io/).

# Jump-diffusion processes
## The theory
Jump-diffusion processes<sup>1</sup>, as the name suggest, are a mixed type of stochastic processes with a diffusive and a jump term.
One form of these processes which is mathematically traceable is given by the [Stochastic Differential Equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_differential_equation)

<img src="/Others/SDE_1.png" title="A jump diffusion process" height="25"/>

which has 4 main elements: a drift term <img src="/Others/a_xt.png" title="drift term" height="18"/>, a diffusion term <img src="/Others/b_xt.png" title="diffusion term" height="18"/>, and jump amplitude term <img src="/Others/xi.png" title="jump amplitude term" height="18"/>, which is given by a Gaussian distribution, and finally a jump rate <img src="/Others/lambda.png" title="jump rate term" height="14"/>.
You can find a good review on this topic in Ref. 2.

## Integrating a jump-diffusion process
Let us use the functions in `JumpDiff` to generate a jump-difussion process, and subsequently retrieve the parameters. This is a good way to understand the usage of the integrator and the non-parametric retrieval of the parameters.

First we need to load our library. We will call it `jd`
```python
import JumpDiff as jd
```
Let us thus define a jump-diffusion process and use `jdprocess` to integrate it. Do notice here that we need the drift <img src="/Others/a_xt.png" title="drift term" height="18"/> and diffusion <img src="/Others/b_xt.png" title="diffusion term" height="18"/> as functions.

```python
# integration time and time sampling
t_final = 10000
delta_t = 0.001

# A drift function
def a(x):
    return -0.5*x

# and a (constant) diffusion term
def b(x):
    return 0.75

# Now define a jump amplitude and rate
xi = 2.5
lamb = 1.75

# and simply call the integration function
X = jd.jdprocess(t_final, delta_t, a=a, b=b, xi=xi, lamb=lamb)
```

This will generate a jump diffusion process `X` of length `int(10000/0.001)` with the given parameters.

<img src="/Others/X_trajectory.png" title="A jump-difussion process" height="200"/>

## Using `JumpDiff` to retrieve the parameters
### Moments and Kramers─Moyal coefficients
Take the timeseries `X` and use the function `moments` to retrieve the conditional moments of the process.
For now let us focus on the shortest time lag, so we can best approximate the Kramers─Moyal coefficients.
For this case we can simply employ

```python
edges, moments = jd.moments(timeseries = X)
```
In the array `edges` are the limits of our space, and in our array `moments` are recorded all 6 powers/order of our conditional moments.
Let us take a look at these before we proceed, to get acquainted with them.

We can plot the first moment with any conventional plotter, so lets use here `plotly` from `matplotlib`

```python
import matplotlib.plotly as plt

# we want the first power, so we need 'moments[1,...]'
plt.plot(edges, moments[1,...])
```
The first moment here (i.e., the first Kramers─Moyal coefficient) is given solely by the drift term that we have selected `-0.5*x`

<img src="/Others/1_moment.png" title="The 1st Kramers─Moyal coefficient" height="200"/>

And the second moment (i.e., the second Kramers─Moyal coefficient) is a mixture of both the contributions of the diffusive term <img src="/Others/b_xt.png" title="diffusion term" height="18"/> and the jump terms <img src="/Others/xi.png" title="jump amplitude term" height="18"/> and <img src="/Others/lambda.png" title="jump rate term" height="14"/>.

<img src="/Others/2_moment.png" title="The 2nd Kramers─Moyal coefficient" height="200"/>

You have this stored in `moments[2,...]`.

### Retrieving the jump-related terms
Naturally one of the most pertinent questions when addressing jump-diffusion processes is the possibility of recovering these same parameters from data. For the given jump-diffusion process we can use the `jump_amplitude` and `jump_rate` functions to non-parametrically estimate the jump amplitude <img src="/Others/xi.png" title="jump amplitude term" height="18"/> and jump rate <img src="/Others/lambda.png" title="jump rate term" height="18"/> terms.

After having the `moments` in hand, all we need is

```python
# first estimate the jump amplitude
xi_est = jd.jump_amplitude(moments = moments)

# and now estimated the jump rate
lamb_est = jd.jump_rate(moments = moments)
```
which resulted in our case in `(xi_est) ξ = 2.43 ± 0.17` and `(lamb_est) λ = 1.744 * delta_t` (don't forget to divide `lamb_est` by `delta_t`)!

### Other functions and options
Include in this package is also the [Milstein scheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milstein_method) of integration, particularly important when the diffusion term has some spacial `x` dependence. `moments` can actually calculate the conditional moments for different lags, using the parameter `lag`.

In `formulae` the set of formulas needed to calculate the second order corrections are given (in `sympy`).
